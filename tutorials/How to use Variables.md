Go to the submit part of config.json and choose wich type of message you want to choose, in this case i will use replyToInteraction.

Check [Explainations.md](https://github.com/PlayboyPrime/ModalMod/blob/main/Explanations.md) for all variables

In my case i want to write Thanks (username) for your submission!

To do this i will have to use the {user.name} variable.
